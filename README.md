 This project predicts employee attrition using HR data.

 Objective
To analyze HR dataset and build ML models that predict whether an employee will leave the company.

 Dataset
- Contains employee demographics, job role, work environment, and attrition status.

 Steps Done
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC)

 Results
- Best model: **Random Forest** with ~86% accuracy.
- Key factors influencing attrition: Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Work-Life Balance.

 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
